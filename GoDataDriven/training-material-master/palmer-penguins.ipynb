    "# Palmer Penguins: a machine learning example\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## About the data\n",
    "The data was collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antartica LTER. The goal of the dataset is to provide a great dataset for data exploration, visualisation and - in this case - a demonstration of the scikit-learn API. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Scikit-Learn\n",
    "Scikit-learn is *the* library for machine learning in Python. You could consider it the swiss army knife of machine learning. A wide variety of machine learning models are implemented by the community and core developers, with a consistent API. Once you master this API, it's easy to apply a wide variety of machine learning algorithms, and you have a handy tool to help you out with preprocessing, model evaluation and model selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why scikit-learn?\n",
    "- Many available machine learning models\n",
    "- Models are implemented by an expert team and checked by a large community\n",
    "- Covers most machine-learning tasks\n",
    "- Commitment to documentation, consistency and usability\n",
    "- Designed to work with other key Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Penguin classification\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate classification of penguins species based on bodily measurements with the scikit-learn API. We will cover the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loading the data\n",
    "2. Preparing the data for sklearn\n",
    "3. Model creation & evaluation\n",
    "4. Model visualisation "
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## 1. Loading our data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many places your data can originate from. Maybe you want to load it from a Excel file you have stored locally on your system, maybe you have a .csv file stored online somewhere. Scikit-learn comes with various standard datasets that can be used for practice, that can be loaded if you have scikit-learn installed on your system. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the dataset we will be using today (the Palmer penguins dataset) does not come from scikit-learn, but from a visualisation package called `seaborn`. A dataset loaded from seaborn will be a Pandas dataframe and can be used as such. Pandas is a powerful library for data wrangling."

Even if the model is correct, do we know whether it has really truly learned the relationship between the features and the targets (ie. flipper length of >X is always species Y), or has it simply memorized the original data and does it recognise penguin A from the training phase? \n",
